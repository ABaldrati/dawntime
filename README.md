## About The Project

In ```dawntime``` we implement a volumetric light scattering effect based on the postprocessing technique described by Kenny Mitchell [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-ii-light-and-shadows/chapter-13-volumetric-light-scattering-post-process).

This project contains five demostrations scene which implement the volumetric light scattering technique linked above.

### Built With

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)




## Installation

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo

git clone https://gitlab.com/reddeadrecovery/dawntime
```
2. Run ```npm install``` in the root folder of the repo


## Usage

Just run ```npm start``` to start the webserver and navigate to http://localhost:8080
