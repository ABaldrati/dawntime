## About The Project

In ```dawntime``` we implement a volumetric light scattering effect based on the postprocessing technique described by Kenny Mitchell [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-ii-light-and-shadows/chapter-13-volumetric-light-scattering-post-process). 

### Built With

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
